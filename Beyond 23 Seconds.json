  "description": "A young protagonist who, feeling disconnected from his surroundings, leaps from a high bridge and experiences a transformative journey into an alternate reality. This act serves as a metaphorical gateway, prompting him to question the nature of his existence and the world around him. Throughout the series, the protagonist confronts various challenges that interplay between reality and illusion, compelling him to make choices that define his identity and destiny. The narrative explores themes of self-discovery, the courage to pursue one's convictions despite societal pressures, and the quest for authenticity in a world rife with facades.\n\nCredits: Carbon Scans\nhttps://discord.gg/NeRxb3p85Y",
